# About Me
Hello! I am Kev.
I'm just a dude developing random stuff. Welcome to my Repository!

# So, What's in here?
Go to [Index](index.md), it'll have everything in there.

# Hobbies
I like to program, obviously. I do like to mod, such as Kev's Blank Manufactory (A Vic's Point Blank compat mod with Create for ammunition crafting), and another mod for Days Gone. Professionally speaking, I'll be developing various Flutter/Java programs, among others.

# Why I'm Doing This (Reflection)
My top choice of career would have to be in game dev. I just like… video games, so I don’t really see why not. I have loved games since I was 5, playing on roblox and stuff. I would need plenty of communication skills that I’ll obtain from this course, as without it, I probably would get fired. Without co-operation skills, I probably would cause more chaos than help, thus why I would get fired.
