### What is Flutter?
- Definition:
Flutter is an open-sourse UI software development kit, utilizing Dart as it's main language. It's developed by Google LLC, and is used for both web and app development.

Flutter allows us to easily develop highly interactive UI apps, compared to say HTML or plain old Java.

|--|--|--|
| Widget | A "design" feature, like Text or Image.network. | The universal building blocks. |
| MaterialApp | Core of a Flutter app. | Just the core. |
| Scaffold | Expands to fill the available space. | Automatically resizes for keyboards. |
| StatelessWidget | Does not redraw itself every value update. | The opposite of Stateful. |
| StatefulWidget | Redraws itself every value update. | The opposite of Stateless. |
| Navigator | Navigates between Routes. | Absoluetly nessasry for naviagation. |
| AppBar | Contains common actions at the top or bottom. | Otherwise known as a toolbar. |
| Column | Aligns many Wigets in a vertical row. | Useful for lists and the likes. |
| Row | Aligns many Wigets in a row. | It's just a row. |
| Container | Boxes. From HTML, basically. | The Boxer Model? |
| Text | Letters displayed on a screen. | Text('Hello, World!') |
| Image.network | Displays an image. | Image.network('source_URL') |
| Padding | Adds space around the text. | Functionally similar to HTML padding. |
| Center | Aligns the text to the center of the screen. | Functionally similar to HTML centering. |

### Key Terms and Definitions
| Term | Definition | Base Structure / Syntax | Real Life Example | App Example |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Variable | A named container used to store a value that may change. | `var x = 5;` | A container for stuff. |  |
| Constant | A fixed value that cannot change once set. | `const PI = 3.14;` | A Constant in a science expariment. |  |
| Data Type | The kind of value a variable holds, like numbers or text. | `int`, `String`, `bool` | The label on a container. |  |
| String | A sequence of characters used to represent words or text. | `"Hello World"` | A text message. |  |
| Integer | Whole number values. | `int age = 16;` | Basic math. |  |
| Double | Number values with decimals. | `double age = 16.2;` | Hard math. |  |
| Boolean | A value that can be true or false. | `bool isLoggedIn = false;` | A yes or no question. |  |
| List | A collection of values in a specific order. | `List<String> names = [];` | A list of questions, in an ordered test. |  |
| Null | A special value that means “nothing.” | `String? name = null;` | The funny number, used to break games sometimes. Baically void-lite. |  |
| Function | A reusable block of code that performs an action. | `void sayHi() { print("Hi"); }` | A machine that does one thing. |  |
| Paramater | The information passed into a function to change how it works. | `greet(String name)` | The settings for a machine. |  |
| Return | The result a function gives back. | `return total;` |  |  |
| Scope | Where a variable or function can be used. | (No set syntax — concept-based) |  |  |
| Class | Blueprint for creating objects with specific structure and behavior. | `class Dog {}` |  |  |
| Object | A specific version of a class. | `Dog myDog = Dog();` |  |  |
| Property | A variable that belongs to a class/object. | `String name;` |  |  |
| Method | A function that belongs to a class. | `void bark() {}` |  |  |
| Constructor | A special function used to set up a class when it’s created. | `Dog(this.name);` |  |  |
| Abstraction | Hiding the inner workings of code so users only interact with what they need. | (Concept — not specific code) |  |  |
| Override | Changing how a built-in or inherited function behaves. | `@override` |  |  |
| Void | A function that does not return a value. | `void printMessage() {}` |  |  |
